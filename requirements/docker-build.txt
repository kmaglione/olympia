# A separate requirements for the build portion of the
# base docker file. We need --no-binary flags here, so
# we can be sure certain packages will build new wheels,
# but we need to avoid adding them to a post-base-image
# build, so those binary wheels are actually installed.

# This file can be done away with once we decide which binary wheels we can
# safely host in our wheelhouse, and how to deploy binary packages to production
# in their absence.
